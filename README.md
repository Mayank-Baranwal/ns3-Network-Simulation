# ns3-Network-Simulation 
Implemented a point to point dumbbell network topology with ns-3. Simulated the effect of network bottlenecks with three TCP variants (Hybla, Westwood+, and YeAH) (measured in terms of throughput and goodput). Analyzed how each TCP variant deals with packet loss and network congestion by tracking the evolution of the congestion window over time.
